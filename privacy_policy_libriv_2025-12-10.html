    <h1>Privacy Policy – Libriv</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: <strong>10.12.2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      Libriv (“App”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a reading-tracker application designed to help users improve reading habits,
      track progress, and enhance their reading experience through social features and gamification. We respect your
      privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using Libriv, you agree to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>
      The data controller is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mateusz Ignacik</strong><br />
      E-mail: <a href="mailto:mateuszignacik00@gmail.com">mateuszignacik00@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve the App’s features.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Voluntarily</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Account information: e-mail address, username, profile picture (optional).</li>
      <li>Reading activity: books added, reading sessions, pages read, time spent, goals.</li>
      <li>Photos and quotes: images and text you choose to upload or capture inside the App.</li>
      <li>Social and club activity: posts, comments, reactions, book club memberships (if you use these features).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Device and Usage Data</h3>
    <p>Collected automatically when you use the App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (model, operating system version).</li>
      <li>App usage data (screens visited, basic interaction events).</li>
      <li>Firebase Installation ID or similar identifiers.</li>
      <li>Crash logs and performance data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not collect precise GPS location or your contacts through the App.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Camera</h3>
    <p>
      The App may request access to your device camera so that you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>take a photo of a quote or book page,</li>
      <li>take a photo tied to a reading session (e.g., reading setup, environment),</li>
      <li>add an image to your feed or book club post.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The camera is only used when you explicitly choose to capture a photo. The App does not take pictures or record
      video in the background.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Photos / Media / Files (Gallery Access)</h3>
    <p>
      The App may request access to your device storage or photo library so that you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>select an existing photo from your gallery,</li>
      <li>upload a picture as part of a reading session, quote or social post.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You choose which photos to upload. The App does not browse or upload your entire gallery automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Focus Mode / Do Not Disturb Settings</h3>
    <p>
      Libriv includes a focus mode feature that helps you concentrate on reading. When you use this feature, the App may:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>open your device’s system settings page related to &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; or similar focus modes,</li>
      <li>provide guidance on how to enable or customize Do Not Disturb on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The App does not enable, disable, or modify Do Not Disturb mode by itself and does not read the content of your
      notifications. Any changes are made by you directly in the system settings.
    </p>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create and maintain your user account,</li>
      <li>sync your reading progress and statistics across sessions or devices,</li>
      <li>display your streaks, levels, rankings, avatars, and achievements,</li>
      <li>enable social features, such as feeds, comments, reactions, and book clubs (if you use them),</li>
      <li>store the photos and quotes you choose to upload,</li>
      <li>improve the App’s stability, performance, and user experience,</li>
      <li>analyze aggregated usage to understand how the App is used and which features are most valuable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing (If Applicable)</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location (e.g., if you are in the European Economic Area), we process your data under one or
      more of the following legal bases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for example, when you grant camera or gallery access, upload photos, or add optional profile details.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to provide the core App functionality once you register or start using Libriv.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – such as improving the App, preventing abuse, and ensuring security.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance with legal obligations</strong> – when we are required by law to retain certain information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Storage and Services Used</h2>
    <p>
      We rely on trusted third-party services to store and process data, primarily:
    </p>
    <h3>Firebase (Google LLC)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud Firestore – for data storage (e.g., reading stats, user profiles).</li>
      <li>Firebase Authentication – for secure user login and account management.</li>
      <li>Firebase Storage – for storing photos or images you upload.</li>
      <li>Firebase Crashlytics – for crash reporting and stability improvement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Data may be processed on servers located outside of your country, including in the United States. Google and its
      services implement appropriate safeguards and security measures in line with applicable data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We may share your data with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers such as Firebase/Google, solely to operate and improve the App.</li>
      <li>Analytics and crash reporting tools, to better understand issues and usage.</li>
      <li>Authorities or legal entities, only when required by law or to protect our rights and the safety of users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information to advertisers or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Libriv is not intended for children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, you may not use the App. In some
      regions, stricter age limits may apply (for example, under 16 in the EU without parental consent).
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal
      data, please contact us so that we can delete the data and, if necessary, the account.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>access the personal data we hold about you,</li>
      <li>request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data,</li>
      <li>request deletion of your data and account,</li>
      <li>restrict or object to certain types of processing,</li>
      <li>withdraw your consent where processing is based on consent,</li>
      <li>request data portability, where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can often manage and delete your data directly through the App (for example, by deleting content or your
      account). You can also contact us at
      <a href="mailto:mateuszignacik00@gmail.com">mateuszignacik00@gmail.com</a> to exercise your rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority if you believe your rights have
      been violated.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your personal data for as long as you maintain an account or as needed to provide the App’s services.
      If you delete your account or request deletion of your data, we will remove or anonymize your personal
      information within a reasonable period, unless we are legally required to keep certain data longer.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encrypted connections
      (HTTPS), access controls, and secure configuration of third-party services.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. While we strive to protect your data, we
      cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App, legal requirements, or
      processing practices. When we make significant changes, we may notify you within the App or by other appropriate
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
